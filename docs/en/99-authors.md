## About the authors

**Yohan Lasorsa** is a web developer and Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.

Open-source enthusiast and software craftsman, the web is the ultimate playground for Yohan. With a background of 15+ years in various fields such as applied research on mobile and IoT, architecture consulting and cloud applications development, he worked all the way down to the low-level stacks before diving into web development. As a full stack engineer and DIY hobbyist, he now enjoys pushing bits of JavaScript everywhere he can while sharing his passion with others.

**Christopher Maneu** is a developer/data engineer and Principal Cloud Advocate at Microsoft. His mission is to help every technologist on the planet succeed, focusing on data and data team behind the applications.

Before joining Azure Engineering, Christopher helped large corporations and startups creating user-friendly apps & services and helping build teams behind these services. He used to be an engineering lead at Deezer.com, a worldwide music streaming service.

When Christopher is not working in front of this computer, he's probably cooking (and yes, these recipes are on GitHub), or sharing his (other) passion: Scuba Diving.
